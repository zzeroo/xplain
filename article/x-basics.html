        <h3>Basic Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            Although it may sound a bit stilted, notice how I keep saying "the X Window System" instead of the more
            traditional shorthands "X", "X11", or "Xorg"? I want to be very careful to separate the ideas and design of
            the system from its component parts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The X Window System is a networked display system. A server component, the
            <span class="definition">X server</span>, is responsible for coordinating between all of the clients
            connected, taking input from the mouse and keyboard, and pushing pixels on the output. The most popular X
            server implementation is the <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver">Xorg X server</a>,
            developed by the X.Org Foundation and community. There are other X server implementations: you might
            remember that Xorg was forked from <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> a decade ago, that Sun
            Microsystems has had several X server implementations, in both
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xsun">Xsun</a> and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xnews_%28X11_server%29">XNeWS</a>. Today, Xorg is the dominant
            X server implementation, getting most of the development. But back in the day, multiple competing
            implementations existed.
        </p>
        <p>
            X servers and X clients all talk a standardized network protocol to each other, known as
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html">X11</a>. This protocol is
            well-specified, from the wire format to the semantics of every request. The protocol documentation linked
            above is invaluable documentation for any hacker who wants to learn more about this stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Applications and toolkits don't write the wire format onto the socket directly, however. They often use
            client libraries that implement the protocols, like the traditional
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.html">Xlib</a> library, or the
            somewhat newer <a href="http://xcb.freedesktop.org/">xcb</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm going to try and be precise in my nomenclature in this article.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I talk about features or design decisions of the overall system, I will try to call it
            <span class="definition">the X Window System</span>, even if it sounds a bit verbose. e.g.
            <q><span class="definition">The X Window System</span> provides us Pixmaps, which are images in the
            server's memory.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            When I talk about features or details of the network protocol, I will talk about
            <span class="definition">the X11 protocol</span>. e.g. <q><span class="definition">The X11 protocol</span>
            provides for a generic extension mechanism, which allows for a forward-compatible way to implement new
            features without having to redesign older parts of X11</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I talk about the behavior of a client or a server, I'll say <span class="definition">X client</span>
            or <span class="definition">X server</span> e.g. <q>Using the MIT-SHM extension, <span class="definition">X
            clients</span> can pass memory buffers to the <span class="definition">X server</span> using POSIX shared
            memory, which prevents networking and large copies</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I talk about features or the architecture in the Xorg X server implementation, I'll mention it
            explicitly as <span class="definition">Xorg</span> or <span class="definition">the Xorg X server</span>,
            e.g. <q>In order to make drawing calls accelerated, <span class="definition">Xorg</span> video drivers can
            provide hardware-accelerated versions of certain drawing primitives through EXA.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            If I ever say "such-and-such is a feature of X", it's a bug.

        <section id="requests-and-events">
        <h3>Requests and events</h3>
        <p>
            As said in the Introduction, <span class="definition">X clients</span> connect to an
            <span class="definition">X server</span>, and they speak an <span class="definition">X11 protocol</span>.
            In more detail, clients can send <span class="definition">requests</span> to ask the X server to do
            something. A simple example of a request is
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#requests:CreateWindow" class="code-literal">CreateWindow</a>,
            which tells the X server to "create a window". We'll learn more about windows in a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            If something interesting happens inside the X server (for instance, a window was created), the X server
            can send X clients an <span class="definition">event</span>. To prevent network traffic from getting
            overloaded, X clients need to tell the X server which events they're interested in. The network side of it
            is a bit complicated (it's ugly, let's not get into it), but programs using Xlib can tell the X server that
            they wants to listen to specific events using the
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.html#XSelectInput" class="code-literal">XSelectInput</a>
            function call.

        <div class="demo-server" data-demo="two-kittens"></div>
        <p>
            Let's start super simple. Here's a simple X server with two windows in it. They don't have any title bars,
            and you can't drag them around because I haven't launched a
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#glossary:Window_manager" class="definition">window manager</a>
            yet. There's just two windows, each showing each kitten.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might notice that <span class="inspector-icon">i</span> button in the top right of the demo above.
            Click on it, and the inspector will pop open. On the left side of the inspector is a list of windows,
            and on the right side are the properties and attributes for the selected window.
        </p>
        <p>
            This lets you dig into all the demos in this article in detail, showing how things are constructed.
            So, if you ever find yourself not quite understanding something I'm saying, playing around with the
            inspector can often help.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <span class="definition">window</span>, in the X11 protocol, is a structure that allows an
            <span class="definition">X client</span> connecting to the X server to display something on the screen,
            and take input as well. Windows are fairly simple: they have an X, a Y, a width, and a height. This forms
            a rectangle which is known as the window's <span class="definition">bounding rectangle</span>. The window
            occupies this space. Windows also have a defined <span class="definition">stacking order</span>, which
            means that some windows can be above other windows. If a window is higher in the stacking order, it
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#glossary:Occlude" class="definition">occludes</a>
            the windows below it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For historical reasons related to some initial implementations, showing a window in the X11 protocol
            is called <span class="definition">mapping</span> a window, and hiding a window is called
            <span class="definition">unmapping</span>. Windows, when initially created, are unmapped (or hidden).
            Clients have to map windows by sending a
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#requests:MapWindow" class="code-literal">MapWindow</a>
            request to the X server, and clients can later unmap windows using
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#requests:UnmapWindow" class="code-literal">UnmapWindow</a>.
            Note that unmapping a window doesn't destroy a window &mdash; doing so simply hides it. The window can
            then be mapped again later. It's more like minimizing a window (in fact, that's how minimization is
            implemented on most window managers).
        </p>
        <p>
            So, we know what windows are. But how are those kittens getting on the screen?
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="expose-model">
        <h3>Exposing historical baggage</h3>
        <p>
            In the late 80s, when the X Window System was designed, RAM was costly, and was a scarce resource.
            If we stored window contents in system memory, if you want to have a maximized window, that would be,
            well, 1 byte * (800 * 600 pixels) =
            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1%20byte%20*%20800%20*%20600%20=">almost half a megabyte!</a>
            The user can't open more than 10 maximized windows before exhausting the 5MB in his workstation, and
            with 16-bit True Color around the corner, we can't fit more than 5! No, no, this can't possibly scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, if we can't store window pixels in system memory, where can we store them? They have to exist
            somewhere, <em>right</em>?
        </p>
        <p>
            Nope. The trick the X Window System authors realized is that the pixels for a window don't have to exist
            at all. We only have one giant buffer of pixels for the entire screen, the
            <span class="definition">front buffer</span>, and windows borrow pixels to draw to.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-server" data-demo="expose"></div>
        <p>
            The demo above shows two windows, with one window occluding the other. The window underneath moves from
            side to side, and you can see that when it moves, the window blanks out for a moment before redrawing
            itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            The window on top, marked as <span class="code-literal">kitten1.png</span> in the inspector, owns
            a rectangle in the center of the screen. The window below, <span class="code-literal">kitten2.png</span>,
            owns a "L" shape slightly below and to the left.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the X server needs pixels from a window, it tells the window to redraw the area it's missing
            pixels for using an
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#events:Expose" class="code-literal">
            Expose</a> event. The window then responds by submitting drawing commands back to the X server.
            The X server then processes all these drawing commands, touching pixels on the front buffer where the
            window is.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also drag <span class="code-literal">kitten1.png</span> around. Try it, and see if you can figure
            out how this behaves.
            <a href="http://www.mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/effects/ie6/">Does it seem familiar?</a> The authors of
            Windows chose the same design when they wrote their display server, however they called their equivalent
            to the Expose event
            <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd145213%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" class="code-literal">WM_PAINT</a>
            instead.

        <h3>Windows of all shapes and sizes</h3>
        <div class="demo-server" data-demo="shape"></div>
        <p>
            I said above that windows are rectangles. In the above demo, you see a circular window, so it's quite
            obvious that I lied. You can still drag the top window around, but it might slow your browser down.
            Sorry, the math here is a lot more computationally expensive, especially in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Internally, the X server keeps a record of all the pixels that are currently visible for every window,
            containing the part of the window's bounding rectangle that is currently showing on the screen. It's
            calculated by taking the window's overall bounding rectangle and then subtracting out the bounding
            rectangles of all the windows above it. It's somewhat like a simple 1-bit alpha mask.
        </p>
        <p>
            This data structure is called the <span class="definition">clip list</span> in the Xorg codebase.
            As the word "list" in the name might tell you, it's not actually a 1-bit alpha mask. That would waste too
            much memory. Again, for a full-screen 800x600 window, you don't want a giant alpha mask in the server's
            memory telling it that it's mostly visible, or mostly obscured. Instead, the X server stores a more compact
            version of the same thing, as a list of rectangles containing the areas where the window is visible. For
            a 800x600 window that's not occluded, we now went from a 60kb bitmap mask to a rectangle containing four
            32-bit numbers, for a total of 16 bytes. Quite a savings!
        </p>
        <p>
            This data structure is seen throughout X11 programming, and it's known as a
            <span class="definition">region</span>. If you've ever used the
            <a href="http://cairographics.org">cairo graphics library</a>, it has an implementation of regions, called
            <a href="http://cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Regions.html" class="code-literal">cairo_region_t</a>.
            (Actually, both the implementation in the Xorg codebase and the one in cairo are the same code, they're
            both using the <a href="http://www.pixman.org/">pixman</a> library, underneath.)
        </p>
        <p>
            However, like any data structure, it isn't efficient in all use cases. A simple example here is a
            checkerboard pattern: instead of one bit per pixel, now we have 16 bytes per pixel! This is much more
            computationally expensive to work with, and takes a lot more memory. Thankfully, not a lot of software
            will use a checkerboard region.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ahem, sorry. Enough reminiscing. Anyway, the story goes that when people working on the X server source
            code were doing anything with windows, they had code that looked like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="c">void do_something_with_window(Window window)
{
    Region region = new Region();
    region.add_rectangle(window.bounding_rectangle);

    region.intersect_rectangle(other_window.whatever);
    draw_some_nonsense(region);
}</pre></code>
        <p>
            That is, the code was almost always taking the window's bounding rectangle, and then converting it into a
            region to use elsewhere. So, they said to themselves, <q class="historical-quote">Hey, why don't we let the
            user set any arbitrary region that will be used instead of the bounding region?</q> And thus, the
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xextproto/shape.html">X SHAPE Extension</a> was born.
            The X SHAPE Extension allows the user to instead tell the X server to use a
            <span class="definition">bounding region</span> instead of a bounding rectangle.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is how we get a circular window, as above: we construct a region of a circle, and then set
            the window's bounding region to be that circle. This is also how the classic
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeyes">xeyes</a> and oclock get their classic cutout shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The inspector will show the bounding shape region of a window in yellow.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two more notes I want to make here. Although this might seem like it would allow for some windows
            to be semitransparent by poking holes in them, it's still all-or-nothing: either the window is fully
            transparent, or it's not. That is, if you take your finger and point to any pixel on the above display,
            I can do some math and tell you the exact window that will paint to that pixel at any point in time.
            The X SHAPE Extension doesn't change this, it just makes the logic for figuring out which window "owns" a
            specific pixel more complicated than testing against simple rectangles. In order to allow for true
            semitransparent windows, we'll have to somehow figure out a way to blend between the pixels that windows
            draw. We'll explore that another time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, setting a bounding region that's larger than the window's width/height can't actually make
            the window own some pixels that it wouldn't own otherwise. The X SHAPE Extension only allows a window
            to carve away from where it would normally paint and give that space to the windows underneath.
        </p>

        <section id="pixmaps">
        <h3>Pixmaps</h3>
        <p>
            The more attentive of you playing around with that last demo might have noticed something special when
            poking around in <span class="code-literal">kittencircle.png</span> with the inspector. In the
            <span class="inspector-section-header">Attributes</span> section of the inspector,
            you might have noticed a <span class="code-literal">background-pixmap</span> attribute, and hovering over
            it shows the circle kitten image! That raises a few questions: first of all, what is a Pixmap? Why didn't
            the other windows have a <span class="code-literal">background-pixmap</span> attribute? They seemed to have
            a <span class="code-literal">background-pixel</span> attribute instead. What's with that?
        </p>
        <p>
            You might have been wondering how it could have been efficient to keep transfering missing pixels for the
            kitten images at 60 frames per second, over a network connection in the 80s. The answer is that we're not.
            Instead, when we create the window and load the image in, the code creates a
            <span class="definition">Pixmap</span>, which allows us to have memory-backed pixel storage on the server.
            We then upload the pixels for the kitten image to the Pixmap once, using a

            request.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever we want to draw to the window from an <span class="code-literal">Expose</span> event, we simply
            tell the X server to copy from the kitten pixels it already has in its memory space. To do that, we make a
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#requests:CopyArea" class="code-literal">CopyArea</a>
            from the Pixmap to the Window. No more copying done.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might have noticed the word <span class="definition">Drawable</span> in the protocol documentation.
            A <span class="Definition">Drawable</span> is something that the user can draw to, which is either a
            Pixmap or a Window. A Pixmap draws to its own memory storage, but a Window draws to the pixels on the
            front buffer which it owns.
        </p>
        <p>
            <q>OK, so, then what's this about <span class="code-literal">background-pixel</span> and
            <span class="code-literal">background-pixmap</span>?</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            When the X server sends <span class="code-literal">Expose</span> events to a window, keep in mind that
            means that there are pixels "missing" from the front buffer that need to be redrawn. It needs to fill in
            the missing pixels with <em>something</em>, and the X server provides a window with three options:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                It can fill the pixels with a color. This is what the
                <span class="code-literal">background-pixel</span> attribute specifies.
            </li>
            <li>
                It can fill the pixels with the contents of a pixmap. This is what the
                <span class="code-literal">background-pixmap</span> attribute specifies.
            </li>
            <li>
                It can do nothing, and simply leave whatever pixels were there before, and wait for the application
                to redraw. This is also the default, and it's what you get when there's no explicit
                <span class="code-literal">background-pixel</span> or
                <span class="code-literal">background-pixmap</span> attributes.

                This is how Windows works, and why you see the repeated "IE6 crashed" window when iexplorer.exe
                hangs: it can't respond to the <span class="code-literal">WM_PAINT</span> events, so the old pixel
                contents stay on the screen!
            </li>
        </ol>

            What is that mysterious "Root Window" we saw in the inspector? How do desktop environments set it up so that
            windows can be dragged and resized? Why do I have to use <span class="code-literal">GtkEventBox</span> in
            order to make my widgets respond to input?
        </p>

            All those questions, and more, will be answered... next time! In "Advanced Window Techniques"!
